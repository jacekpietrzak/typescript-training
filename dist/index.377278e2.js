// enums - type that is used to enumarate value of a data type.
// lets declare simple person type
const roles = [
    "admin",
    "author",
    "editor"
];
 // let assume that we need to assign a user role to each user. We can declare an array with a set of rules.
 // better approach is to have a seperate file with roles
