// What is a class.
// Js has classes but TS classes are more robust.
// Class in object-oriented programming is a blueprint for creating objects. A class defines the initial values of various properties and methods of an object.
let person5 = {
  name: "John",
  email: "john@mail.com",
  greet: () => console.log(`Hello ${person5.name}`),
};
// this object will always contain two properties that is the name and email and one method that is a greet method.
