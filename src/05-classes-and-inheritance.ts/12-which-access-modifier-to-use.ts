/**
 * Which access modifier to use?
 * 1 you can start with keeping everything private
 * 2 Once we start building subclasses, and start instantiating objects, we can decide on changes on each member of the class and make them protected or public depending on the requirement.
 * 3 If we dont provide access modifier it will be set to default as public.
