/**
 * Which one should we use?
 * - there is no straight forward answer and it depends on what you are trying to achieve.
 * - if you need to have in your parent any method implementation or a static mehtod then it is better to use abstract class.
 * - if you just looking to create a contract for your classes and classes are bound to implement this contract of interfaces than using interfaces makes much more sense.
 * - if you are confused look at stackoverflow or others and see how people colve the problem you are trying to solve so you can see different solutions and apply the one that works best for you.
