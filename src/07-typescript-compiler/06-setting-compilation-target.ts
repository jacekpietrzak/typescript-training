/**
 * Target property in tsconfig
 * - defines the verion of JS to which TS will be compiled.
 * - version that you use depends on how you are using your TS.
 * - in many cases you will use predefined boilerplate which has all setting defined.
 * - version depends on what you are using. React for instance is using ES5 because it runs in a browser and to maximize compatibility it doesnt use the latest version of JS.
